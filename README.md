# 3D-Object-Models-Maya
Created detailed 3D models showcasing both realism and stylized design, including a Classical Phone, Donut Tray, Skateboard, and Apple Watch. Projects involved high-poly/polygonal modeling, UV mapping, texturing, and lighting to produce visually appealing renders suitable for games, animation, or product visualization.
